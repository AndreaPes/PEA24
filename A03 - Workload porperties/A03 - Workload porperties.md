### Overview
The enclosed files [Trace1.csv](Trace1.csv), [Trace2.csv](Trace2.csv), and [Trace3.csv](Trace3.csv) contain a single column that reports inter-arrival times to an application server.

---

### Results

#### ❌ Mean and Moments
Determine for each file:
- The **Mean** and the second, third, and fourth moments
- The **Variance**, the third, and the fourth centered moments
- The **Skewness** and the fourth standardized moments
- **Standard Deviation**, **Coefficient of Variation**, and **Excess Kurtosis**

#### ❌ Statistical Measures
For each file, compute the following:
- **Median**, **first and third quartile**
- **5th** and **90th percentile**

---

### Graphs

#### ❌ Pearson Correlation Coefficient for Lags m=1 to m=100
Draw a figure with the Pearson Correlation Coefficient for lags **m=1 to m=100**.

#### ❌ Approximated CDF of the Corresponding Distribution
Draw the approximated **CDF** of the corresponding distribution. Please center the figure, so that a significant part of the distribution is visible (i.e., avoid figures where the time scale is so large that the distribution appears almost as a step function).

---

### Python Script

Python script that calculates all the above values and generates the graphs: [**A03.py**](A03.py)

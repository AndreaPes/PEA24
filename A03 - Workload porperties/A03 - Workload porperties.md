# Workload Properties
___
The enclosed files [Trace1.csv](Trace1.csv), [Trace2.csv](Trace2.csv) and [Trace3.csv](Trace3.csv) contain a single column that
reports inter-arrival times to an application server.
___
Determine for each file:
- The Mean and the second, third and fourth moments
- The Variance, the third and the fourth centered moments
- The Skewness and fourth standardized moments
- Standard Deviation, Coefficient of Variation, and Excess Kurtosis
- The median, the first and the third quartile and the 5th and 90th percentile

Then:
- Draw figure with the Pearson Correlation Coefficient for lags m=1 to m=100
- Draw the approximated CDF of the corresponding distribution. Please center the figure, so that a
significant part of the distribution is visible (i.e. avoid figures where the time scale is so large that
the distribution appears almost as a step function).

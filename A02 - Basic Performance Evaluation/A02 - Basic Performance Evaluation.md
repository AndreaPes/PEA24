# Basic Performance Evaluation
___
The enclosed files [Logger1.csv](Logger1.csv) and [Logger2.csv](Logger2.csv) are the same as the two columns in
Example 1: they represent respectively the inter-arrival time between two requests to a server, and
the service time required by each request. The value is expressed in minutes.
---
Consider an increase in the workload, that reduces the inter-arrival time of a fraction 𝑎, that is:
𝑎′
𝑖 = 𝛼 ∙ 𝑎𝑖
- Which is the maximum arrival rate [expressed in jobs per minutes] that can be handled with an
average response time of 20 minutes?
Consider now a fraction 𝑎 that produces an arrival rate of 1.2 jobs per minute.
- Which should be the fraction 𝛽 at which we must reduce the service time, i.e.
𝑠′
𝑖 = 𝛽 ∙ 𝑠𝑖
so that the average response time is less than 15 minutes?
